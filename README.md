### ![Android Architecture image](./assets/android-development-vector.png)

### **1. Set Up Your Development Environment**

Before you start coding, you need to set up your tools.

#### **Install Android Studio**

- Android Studio is the official IDE for Android development.
- Download it from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/).
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

#### **Install Java or Kotlin**

- Android development primarily uses **Java** or **Kotlin**.
- Kotlin is now the preferred language for Android development, as recommended by Google.
- Android Studio comes with the necessary SDKs and tools, but ensure you have the latest version of Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

### **2. Learn the Basics of Android Development**

#### **Understand the Android Architecture**

- Learn about the Android operating system, its components, and how apps interact with the system.
- Key components:
  - **Activities**: Represents a single screen with a user interface.
  - **Fragments**: Reusable portions of the UI.
  - **Intents**: Used for communication between components.
  - **Services**: Background tasks.
  - **Broadcast Receivers**: Respond to system-wide events.
  - **Content Providers**: Manage shared app data.

#### **Learn Kotlin**

- If you're new to Kotlin, start with the basics:

  - Variables, data types, control flow, functions, classes, and objects.
  - Kotlin is concise and modern, so itâ€™s easier to learn than Java.

  **W3school** provide excellent resources [www.w3schools.com/kotlin](https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/)

- If you prefer Java, ensure you understand object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

#### **Understand XML for UI Design**

- Android uses XML to define the user interface (UI) of an app.
- Learn how to create layouts using `LinearLayout`, `RelativeLayout`, `ConstraintLayout`, etc.
